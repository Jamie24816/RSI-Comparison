# RSI-Comparison

Code to prototype a trading model using the RSI indicator between an Index and its constituents.

The difference between index RSI and stock indicator is used as the indicator and as the weighting of investment which should be invested in the stock. It is inspired by the move to more passive investing and the momentum which is produced by it.

Next steps would be to refactor the code and integrate a risk management function which would limit the investment for periods of limited volitility as these could lead to excesive weighting for smaller movements leading to false signals arising.
