# RSI-Comparison
Comparing the RSI of SP500 and its constituents.

Code to compare the RSI of the SP500 and its constituents to try and identify a technical indicator for buying and selling shares.The difference between index RSI and stock indicator is used as the indicator and as the weighting of investment which should be invested in the stock. It is inspired by the move to more passive investing and the momentum which is produced by it.

Next steps would be to integrate a risk management function which would limit the investment for periods of limited volitility as these could lead to excesive weighting for smaller movements leading to false signals arising.
